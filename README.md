# RealTimeChatApp
This real-time chat application demonstrates my expertise in web sockets and backend technologies. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures smooth data flow, while Socket.io facilitates instant messaging. The frontend, designed with clean HTML and CSS, offers an intuitive user interface.
